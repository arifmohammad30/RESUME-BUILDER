## üìñ Overview

ResumeGenius is designed to simplify the resume creation process. It features a decoupled architecture with three main components:

1.  **A Static Landing Page:** A visually appealing, fast-loading page built to showcase the features of the resume builder.
2.  **A Dynamic Builder Application:** A feature-rich Single-Page Application (SPA) where users can input their personal and professional details, select from a variety of templates, and see a live preview.
3.  **A Node.js PDF Generation Service:** A backend server responsible for converting the resume's HTML into a downloadable, high-quality PDF.

This decoupled approach allows each part of the application to be developed and deployed independently.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Intuitive Multi-Step Form:** Guides the user through sections for personal info, experience, education, skills, projects, and certifications.
*   **Multiple Professional Templates:** Choose from a selection of 15+ ATS-friendly resume templates.
*   **Live Preview:** See your resume update in real-time as you type.
*   **High-Quality PDF Downloads:** Generates pixel-perfect PDFs using a server-side headless browser, ensuring the downloaded file matches the preview exactly.
*   **Auto-Save Functionality:** Your progress is automatically saved to your browser's `localStorage`, so you can pick up where you left off.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **No Sign-Up Required:** Completely free to use with no registration needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project uses a monorepo-style structure within a single repository.

```
ResumeGenius/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/                 # Source code for the Builder Application (SPA)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landing-page/           # Self-contained project for the Landing Page
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js               # Node.js backend for PDF generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ netlify.toml            # Deployment configuration for Netlify
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Root dependencies for the Builder & Server
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Architecture

The three applications are deployed independently to leverage the strengths of different hosting platforms.

*   **Landing Page (Static Site)**
    *   **Platform:** **GitHub Pages**
    *   **Workflow:** The `gh-pages` package is used to build the static files and push them to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   **Builder Application (SPA Frontend)**
    *   **Platform:** **Netlify**
    *   **Workflow:** Connected to the `main` branch. Pushing a commit automatically triggers a build on Netlify and deploys the output from the `dist/` directory.
*   **PDF Server (Node.js Backend)**
    *   **Platform:** **Render**
    *   **Workflow:** Connected to the `main` branch. Pushing a commit triggers a new deployment on Render. It installs dependencies from the root `package.json` and runs `server.js`.
    *   **Note:** The server is on a free tier and may "spin down" after inactivity, causing a delay on the first PDF generation request.

The applications are connected via hard-coded URLs and a Netlify environment variable (`VITE_LANDING_URL`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need to run the frontend and backend applications in separate terminals.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arifmohammad30/RESUME-BUILDER.git
cd RESUME-BUILDER
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies for both the builder app and the server from the root directory.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Applications

*   **Terminal 1: Run the Builder Application (Frontend)**

    ```bash
    # Run the Vite development server
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

*   **Terminal 2: Run the PDF Server (Backend)**

    ```bash
    # Run the Node.js server
    npm run server
    ```

    The server will be running on `http://localhost:3001`. The frontend is configured to send requests to this address in development.

### 4. Run the Landing Page (Optional)

The landing page is a separate project in its own directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the landing-page directory
cd landing-page

# Install its dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The landing page will be available at a different port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## üìú Available Scripts

### Root (Builder App & Server)
